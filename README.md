# Monthly Drummer blog backup 

Every month I cleanup the `opml` file for [my Drummer blog](https://ol.amitgawande.com) to keep only the current month entries. Entries for previous months are backed up in this repository. It's a great way to start afresh.

This is inspired by [this monthly ritual by Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/2021/11/01/125625.html?title=theMonthlyRitual).
