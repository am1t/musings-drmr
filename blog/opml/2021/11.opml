As a concept, it's brilliant to imagine the benefits when disparate entities on web, across platforms, could interconnect with one another. But it pains me that this remains only a dream. The standards are too many, and too tricky to implement and make use of individually. Basically, it is difficult to setup and even more so to maintain. I wish that wasn't the case.

I believe Google has a lot of benefit to maintain their user's photos. It's not like they are giving it for free -- they already charge for it indirectly by charging for storage.

						<outline text="* Unlike [my initial comment](https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/issues/14#issuecomment-972864161) to Dave, I understand the benefit of marking a node as Markdown. I can very well choose not to make all nodes as Markdown, but then selectively mark a post, one like this, as Markdown." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:01:06 GMT"/>
						<outline text="* This will be really useful for longer posts as basic styling like italics, bold and links are already well handled. For anything that's not handled like ~strikethrough~ or `inline code`, this would be really useful." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:04:06 GMT"/>
						<outline text="* The whole post is rendered as a single post, each paragraph is not considered as separate node. So, each paragraph does not get its individual link. I like that, though I am not certain if that is intentional." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:45:50 GMT"/>
						<outline text="* The Markdown node cannot handle multiple paragraphs (basically, multiple basic child nodes, which are neither quotes, lists etc). Only way I could make it work is to include `&lt;br/&gt;` at the end. I am certain this is a miss on Dave's part, and he will fix it." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:58:56 GMT"/>
						<outline text="* I can use HTML in Markdown node, refer the last line of this post. Nice!" created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:56:33 GMT"/>
						</outline>
					<outline text="I realized, of course, I will have to pull in the latest `style.css` and other template files. For example, otherwise the list is not rendered correctly -- elements need the style rules. And I believe Dave [hasn't checked in](https://github.com/scripting/drummerCms) the changes yet. I made the changes to [my custom stylesheet](https://github.com/am1t/drummercms) -- I will have to undo this once Dave checks in." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:17:30 GMT"/>

						<outline text="" created="Sun, 21 Nov 2021 03:00:29 GMT"/>
						<outline text="1. If there's any time when I feel I **can use the Markdown elements**, I will convert that node to Markdown. " created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:50:14 GMT"/>
						<outline text="" created="Sun, 21 Nov 2021 03:00:32 GMT"/>
						<outline text="2. If I want to write **a long post with lists and links involved**, or even code snippets, I will convert the title node to Markdown." created="Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:50:32 GMT"/>
						<outline text="" created="Sun, 21 Nov 2021 03:00:34 GMT"/>
