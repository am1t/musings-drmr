Basically, he feels one should charge a fixed price for the content that includes the book in all digital formats. You pay slightly extra for the physical book. I completely agree that one should not pay for the content twice. However, unlike Derek, most authors don't sell their books themselves. As unfortunate as it is, they do that from Amazon.

Surprisingly, all other search engines -- DDG, Bing, Yahoo and others -- tend to rank the individual website higher than the social profiles. An individual's website defines her better.

					<outline text="I have no preference for either of these formats -- at any given time, I am always both reading and listening to a book. However, each has its own peculiarities that make them best suited for a kind of books." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2021 10:43:42 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I love listening to &lt;b&gt;non-fiction&lt;/b&gt;, especially when they are voiced by the authors. It is the best way to read a book, in the voice that wrote those words. But, given the nature of the format, it also becomes very difficult to make notes or highlights, something I do so very often. It's fleeting, the voice doesn't stop for you to break the flow and make notes. I hate this part about audiobooks. I also don't like the fact that, with audiobooks, I can't easily go back and &quot;read&quot; some parts again. Refer to or be awed by them again. The format just doesn't allow that. I also don't understand the benefits of bookmarks in audiobooks -- what's the point? I can never get it right." created="Tue, 26 Oct 2021 10:50:01 GMT"/>
					<outline text="So in short, I would prefer to not listen to anything that would make me pause and think, rethink, make highlights and notes. I would better read it. Of course, most of the times when I purchase an audiobook, I don't know whether it's a book that I should rather read. I just make a guess and I haven't been wrong till now. One of the books &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/21425016?shelf=currently-reading&quot;&gt;that I am currently reading&lt;/a&gt; might break that streak though.

					<outline text="What else? &lt;b&gt;Humour fiction&lt;/b&gt;? Well, that totally depends on who is reading it. If it is Stephen Fry, no choice but to listen to his voice. Plus, are there books written purely in this genre any more? Sigh!" created="Tue, 26 Oct 2021 11:14:53 GMT"/>

At that time, I had created &lt;a href=&quot;http://microthreads.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;Micro.threads&lt;/a&gt; just so that I could follow the timeline in a calmer way.

It's far better now.

					<outline text="Here are a few thoughts on using custom template with Drummer, capturing for future reference.  " created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:10:17 GMT"/>
					<outline text="I have got an understanding of how I can host a custom template, a bit of looking around through &lt;a href=&quot;http://drummer.scripting.com/jackbaty/blog.opml&quot;&gt;Jack Baty's setup&lt;/a&gt; and I got it going. Here's what I will have to do." created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:20:33 GMT">
						<outline text="Host the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml#1628779457000&quot;&gt;template files&lt;/a&gt; - styles.css, code.js and index.html - to some static server. There are two options, get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/caddy&quot;&gt;new droplet with Caddy&lt;/a&gt; or use S3. Either is fine and should do the job. Basically the files need to be publicly accessible." created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:12:25 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Add a new OPML header &quot;urlTemplate&quot; which points to the index.html. Modify this index.html to point to the other two files. " created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:17:05 GMT"/>
						<outline text="This should start using the custom template - basically custom index.html and styles.css. I do not yet see use of modifying the javascript file. At least as for now." created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:18:10 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Now that I see the source of most of the sites from Dave, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://davewiner.com&quot;&gt;davewiner.com&lt;/a&gt;, I realize that they are static one-page JavaScript sites? It's all OPML behind the scenes. I often came across Dave referring to this fact. I never understood the meaning till now. How's this better?" created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 12:05:42 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="What's the difference between attachment and love? It is easy to feel attached to something or someone. You take care of them for a period of time, and you invariably get a sense of attachment with them. Love, now that's a different beast. " created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 08:20:24 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="The biggest problem I have with the tech media covering Apple news is they discuss too much about even the very trivial things. I am tired of being part of the same discussions about names and rumours. Look at any Techmeme coverage, for example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techmeme.com/211012/p26#a211012p26&quot;&gt;this latest one&lt;/a&gt;. " created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 06:49:09 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I got rid of all the noisy streams, unsubscribing those that I have no interest to hear from. I have just stopped following 150 Twitter folks -- most were talking just about technology stuff? Seriously, how unique a perspective can you bring when all you talk about are the same bloody technology companies? " created="Wed, 13 Oct 2021 04:55:35 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I am excited about Windows 11. It looks cleaner -- sure, there might be some things that are broken. Need to check if any is a deal breaker for me. If not, I will upgrade When it is available for me. Oh, did I tell you my PC is eligible for the free upgrade?

				<outline text="I wish I learn to sleep early so that I can get up early. Every now and then, the itch to stay up late always overpowers the thought of larger benefits. And it becomes even more difficult when there is a new toy to play with. Drummer is that toy this time!
